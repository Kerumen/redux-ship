# ![Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clarus/icons/master/rocket-48.png) Redux Ship
> Composable, typable and testable Redux middleware

Redux Ship is a [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) [middleware](http://redux.js.org/docs/advanced/Middleware.html) for side effects which focuses on:

* composition: you can duplicate and reuse sub-stores, as you would do with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) components;
* typing: you can type check your code with 100% coverage in [Flow](https://flowtype.org/);
* testing: you can run unit tests of your side effects, by taking snapshots of their execution traces.

### Influences
Redux Ship is mainly influenced by the [Elm architecture](http://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/) and [Redux Sagas](https://github.com/yelouafi/redux-saga).
